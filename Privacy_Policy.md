# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: March 2, 2025

## Introduction

SquareOne ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use m√∏e ("the Chatbot", "the Application", "the Software"). Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Information

We do not collect personally identifiable information from users through the Chatbot.

### Non-Personal Information

We collect and temporarily store non-personal information about users. This information is collected whenever a user interacts with the Chatbot within a Discord guild, in channels accessible to the Chatbot. This information is limited to chat messages, the Guild ID where the interaction takes place, and Discord ID of the User. The contents of the messages are stored as encoded tensors, and are not readable without Tensor decoding software.

## How We Use Your Information

We may use non-personal information collected from users to:

- Debug, improve and optimize the Chatbot's functionality and user experience.
- Monitor the usage of the Chatbot for technical purposes.
- Provide technical support and respond to user inquiries.

## Retention of Your Information

Stored messages are automatically rotated during a user's interaction with the Chatbot. A maximum of ten (12) encoded messages containing no more than a combined total of 100 word tokens are stored per user. These encoded messages are deleted automatically when a guild member is removed from the guild.

You may request deletion of these messages by using the commands included with the Chatbot, which can be found using the Chatbot's help command.

Guild members with granted privilege may also delete the Chatbot's stored data per-user or the entire guild.

All stored information associated with a Guild is automatically deleted when the Chatbot is removed from the Guild.

## Disclosure of Your Information

We do not disclose information collected from users to third parties except as required for the operation of the Chatbot or as otherwise required by law-enforcement.

## Security of Your Information

We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected through the Chatbot from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure.

## Links to Other Sites

The Chatbot may contain links to other websites or services that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

## Children's Privacy

The Chatbot is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page with a new effective date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
