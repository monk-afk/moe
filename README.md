This Readme needs more attention. I'll get to it eventually
___

- > Keyword Trigger
  - The bot responds to messages containing the keywords "moe" or "bot".
- > Channel Specific
  - It can be configured to respond only in designated channels.
- > AI Language Model
  - Utilizes the DialoGPT model from Microsoft to simulate chat.

### Response Generation Parameters

- > inputs (required)
  - text (required)
    - The last input from the user in the conversation.
  - generated_responses
    - A list of strings corresponding to the earlier replies from the model.
  - past_user_inputs
    - A list of strings corresponding to the earlier replies from the user. Should be of the same length of generated_responses.
  - parameters
    - a dict containing the following keys:
    - min_length (Default: None).
      - Integer to define the minimum length in tokens of the output summary.
    - max_length (Default: None).
      - Integer to define the maximum length in tokens of the output summary.
    - top_k (Default: None).
      - Integer to define the top tokens considered within the sample operation to create new text. Limits the sampling pool to the top k logits, adding more diversity to the responses.
    - top_p (Default: None).
      - Float to define the tokens that are within the sample operation of text generation. Add tokens in the sample for more probable to least probable until the sum of the probabilities is greater than top_p. Uses nucleus sampling to choose from the smallest possible set of logits whose cumulative probability is at least p.
    - temperature (Default: 1.0).
      - Float (0.0-100.0). The temperature of the sampling operation. 1 means regular sampling, 0 means always take the highest score, 100.0 is getting closer to uniform probability. Controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits before applying softmax. Lower values make the model more confident and deterministic, while higher values increase randomness.
    - repetition_penalty (Default: None).
      - Float (0.0-100.0). The more a token is used within generation the more it is penalized to not be picked in successive generation passes.
    - max_time (Default: None).
      - Float (0-120.0). The amount of time in seconds that the query should take maximum. Network can cause some overhead so it will be a soft limit.
- options
  - a dict containing the following keys:
    - use_cache (Default: true). Boolean. There is a cache layer on the inference API to speedup requests we have already seen. Most models can use those results as is as models are deterministic (meaning the results will be the same anyway). However if you use a non deterministic model, you can set this parameter to prevent the caching mechanism from being used resulting in a real new query.
    - wait_for_model (Default: false) Boolean. If the model is not ready, wait for it instead of receiving 503. It limits the number of requests required to get your inference done. It is advised to only set this flag to true after receiving a 503 error as it will limit hanging in your application to known places.

## Changelog

0.0.2 - Added PostgreSQL support with separate channel contexts
0.0.1 - Initial Public Release

## To do

 -[ ] Auto-delete channel data when bot is removed from a guild
 -[ ] Reply to replies to bot messages:
> ```py
>   referenced_message = await message.channel.fetch_message(message.reference.message_id)
>   if referenced_message.author == bot.user:
>       is_reply_to_bot = True
> ```
